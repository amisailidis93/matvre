# Introducing Matvre

Mature is an open source blog theme not tied to any one CMS or framework (that means you'll need to do a little more than drag-and-drop to get it working on Wordpress, Octopress, or whatever). If you like Svbtle, Obtvse, and Simvla, you'll love Matvre.

## Installation

1. Edit the HTML/CSS/JavaScript the way you like.

2. Open it in a browser. It's a website.

3. Hack it and jimmy it into Wordpress.

__Octopress users:__ Send an email to bill@writeapp.me and I'll give you access to a fully functional (yes, drag and drop) Octopress version.

## Why?

To poke fun at all the hype over Svbtle, Obtvse, Simvla, and the rest. I'm a big fan of them all but I think sometimes the hacker community and even the developers of those projects, can take the ideas surrounding their platforms a little too seriously. And I also think Svbtle is kind of all hype.

## In the wild

When it's done Matvre will be the official theme of all [Write.app blogs](https://writeapp.me) and [the official blog theme of Bill Patrianakos](http://billpatrianakos.me).
